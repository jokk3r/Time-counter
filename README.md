## Instructions for students:

### Coming Soon Page

Using the [Boilerplate](./template.md) provided, create a coming soon webpage. The page should show a count down of days, hours, minutes, and seconds. 

  - make sure you use a class that accepts:
    - selector
    - end-date
  - That means the countdown should be initilized like this: ```new CountDown("#countdown", { year: 2020, month: 2, day: 4, hour: 16 })```

- for easier date handling you can use [momentjs](https://momentjs.com)

-  Example once your program is running properly:

### Timing

-   minimum 2 hours (don't stress yourself. We can easily take more time)

### Hints

- if you forgot how classes in JavaScript look like, take a look at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes
- you will need the function ```setInterval()```
- In case you use momentjs: This library has a documentation (https://momentjs.com/docs/). You will propably need the ```durations``` method (https://momentjs.com/docs/#/durations/)
- you DON'T need to use momentum.js. You can use any other library or implement it without any library
- dealing with dates can be a pain. Take your time, google, try around and don't give up :)
- team up if necessary
- if you copy&paste code from the web please make sure to understand it
- you can use bootstrap for styling (use npmjs.org https://www.npmjs.com/package/bootstrap-css-only)
